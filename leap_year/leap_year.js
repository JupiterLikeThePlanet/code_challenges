// Problem: Check whether a given year is a leap year or not.

// Input: A year
// Output: A boolean value of whether the year is a leap year or not

// Pseudocode
// Create a function that takes a year as a parameter
// Make an conditional statement:
// --> 1st check use an 'or' statement to see if year is not divisible by four or evenly divided by 100 and return that it is not a leap year
// --> 2nd make an else if statement using another 'or' operator that checks if year is evenly divisible four using modulus or if the year is evenly divided by 400
